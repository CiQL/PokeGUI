# PokeGUI

This was an assignment for my ICS211 Java programming class in Fall 2017. You can see [the rubric we were given](README_OLD.md) and [my grade for the assignment](https://github.com/CiQL/PokeGUI/pull/1).

Now it's just here so I can showcase to people that, yes, I can work in Java.

Notes:

- Yes, the `Species/` folder is filled with Java files for approximately 251 Pok√©mon, without using proper inheritance in most cases, because I wrote a Python script to generate the pages. That script is not included, and indeed is lost to time.
- Some parts of the thing don't even work. This was either because I didn't feel like implementing it, or because I didn't know what I was doing. Most frequently it was the former, unless it was a GUI thing, in which case it was probably the latter.
- I programmed the whole thing in jGRASP, which is a Java development tool specifically for use in education. It, ah, wasn't the most optimal IDE. Especially for GUI programming. I did my best, though.
- It's also organized in a pretty wonky way. This is because a lot of the non-GUI files were derived from previous assignments.
- This was a *class project.* Please keep that in mind while browsing.
